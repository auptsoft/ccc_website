          PAPER DELIVERED BY DR MUDA YUSUF, DIRECTOR/CEO, CENTRE FOR THE PROMOTION OF PRIVATE
          ENTERPRISE [CPPE] AT THE CUSTOMS CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE'S OPEN TRADE ROUND TABLE HELD ON
          TUESDAY 28TH MAY 2024 AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL IKOYI LAGOS
        </h2>
        <h4 class="font-bold mb-4">Protocols</h4>
        <p>
          First let me begin by commending the leadership of the Customs Consultative Committee
          [CCC] for organizing this Quarterly Open Trade Roundtable. Distinguished ladies and
          gentlemen, let me at this stage express my profound appreciation to the Chairman of the
          CCC, Aare Hakeem Olanrewaju and his Governing Board for extending invitation to me as
          guest speaker at this roundtable. I immensely appreciate it and do not take for granted.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Robust consultation is very critical to quality governance in any ecosystem – whether
          economic, regulatory, political, social or commercial. Consultation promotes a sense of
          inclusion, and a sense of ownership. We therefore cannot overemphasize the value of and
          significance of consultation for policy and regulatory regimes.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The culture of consultation is even more important in matters of trade which accounts for
          about 16% of our GDP which is about N40 trillion by 2023 estimates of the national Bureau
          of Statistics. Regrettably the contribution of the maritime sector to our GDP is yet to be
          properly captured in our GDP computation. Am hoping that with the impending rebasing of
          our GDP this shortcoming will be corrected. The maritime sector is a crucial sector with
          very strong linkages and impacts on all other sectors of the Nigerian economy.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          International trade activities impact all sectors - manufacturing, agriculture, ICT,
          hospitality, real estate, construction, mining, energy and power, oil and gas,
          transportation etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To the extent that no country in world can be self-sufficient in everything, international
          trade shall remain very relevant to the advancement of all economies.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The impact of trade is systemic, and cross cutting, and that is why we need to pay more
          attention to our international trade ecosystem. We need to make as efficient as it can be.
          This consultative platform is therefore a very valuable one. It is even more important
          given the strategic and central role of the Nigeria customs service in international
          trade. This kind of engagement provides a great deal of benefits which includes the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10 marker:text-xl">
          <li class="mb-2">Better communication between the Nigeria Customs service and its stakeholders.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Better mutual understanding.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">It improves mutual trust</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Its critical and valuable for feedback.</li>
          <li class="mb-4">It enhances trust, credibility</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold">Some Historical Perspective</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I would like to commend all those who contributed to the making the Nigeria Customs
          Service Act 2023, a reality - President Buhari, Leadership of the 9th National Assembly,
          stakeholders in the sector and of course the leadership of the Nigeria Customs service.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Before now we had the Customs and Excise management Act [CEMA] of the 1958. This was a 65
          years old legislation. Even though there were some minor changes over time, no major
          review took place. That meant that a 65-year-old legislation was being used to govern our
          international trade for over 60 years. To say this was anachronists was to put mildly.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Over the decades there had been tremendous transformation in the nature, structure and
          content of trade which raises issues about the obsolesce of the legislations. We cannot
          have a static legislation in a dynamic trade and economic environment.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          However, like all legislations, the 65-year-old Nigeria customs service act 2023 is not a
          perfect legislation. It would therefore be subjected to review from to time in the light
          of the experiences in its operationalization and implementation. It is a living document
          and therefore will be examined from to time in the light of prevailing realities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The event of today offers an opportunity to do some Xray of the law. We will be getting
          very rich perspective from our eminent resource persons as we progress.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Meanwhile, please permit to identify and comment on a few of the sections of the new law.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Rule of Origin</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Section 78 - 82 has comprehensive provisions to guide the rule of origin as it relates to
          international trade , especially where there are preferential benefits rooted in
          integration protocols. This provision is very important because of the challenges it has
          posed to the objective of economic integration. The experience at the sub regional level
          of ECOWAS has not been good. The tendencies are very high for unscrupulous importers to
          seek to take advantage of the ECOMAS protocols on free trade to bring in products from
          countries outside the regional bloc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Unless we have very tight, clear provisions with deterrent sanctions, this practice would
          continue. It had constituted a major problem to our domestic manufacturers. The robustness
          of the provisions on rule of origin is laudable. This is even more important as we prepare
          to take the big leap into the continental economic integration programme - AfCFTA.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">Customs process Simplification: Authorized Economic Operators</h4>
        <p>
          This is covered in section 109. This is critical to the realization of the Trade
          facilitation mandate of the Nigeria Customs Service. It gives easy passage to importers
          that have good record of compliance. It is an excellent reward for compliance. It would
          also help to accelerate the pace of cargo clearance at the ports, and improve cargo
          throughput.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">Special Economic Zones</h4>
        <p>
          Sections 134-141 focuses on special economic zones. This is very crucial to our
          industrialization. The special economic zones have become a major lunch pad for
          industrialization. This has been the experience of many emerging economies. It is a zone
          with numerous incentives to spur industrialization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This value of the special economic zones is recognized in the act and there are adequate
          provisions to support the zone . there are sanctions provisions as well. There had been
          several stories of abuse of the privileges in the zones. Many manufacturers had complained
          about unfair competition arising from such abuses. It is expected that these provisions
          will address these loopholes.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">Intellectual Property Protection</h4>
        <p>
          Section 168 focusses on intellectual property protection. This is a very good provision
          given the huge losses that our creative industry and the entertainment industry have lost
          and continues to lose to intellectual property violations globally. The customs are by
          this provision empowered to detain, arrest, or size items involves in intellectual
          property violations.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">Manufacture of Carbonated Drinks and other beverages excise licensing provisions.</h4>
        <p>
          This is captured in sections 193 - 197. This is of value because of the health
          implications as well revenue optimization.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">Revenue for Customs Operations</h4>
        <p class="mb-3">Section 18</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10 marker:text-xl">
          <li>Minimum of 4% FOB of all imports.</li>
          <li>User fees</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Budget appropriations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          These are very good provisions to make the service very well resourced. This robust
          resource base would position the service to deliver more effectively on its mandate of
          revenue generation, trade facilitation and border security.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 font-bold">CUSTOMS DUTY EXCHANGE RATE</h3>
        <p>Section 67 [a] [iii]</p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This section states that when lodging a declaration, under the provision of this act,
          Declarants shall determine and declare the classifications, valuation and origin of the
          goods and be guided as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Use of official currency of the federal republic of Nigeria using prevailing official
          exchange rate issued by the CBN and applicable at the time of submission of declaration of
          the goods , whether imports or exports. The reality is that this provision di not envisage
          the current level of exchange rate volatility that we are now experiencing. The result is
          that international trade has become very unpredictable because there is no certainty
          around the cost of cargo clearance and import duty to be paid. This is yet another
          instance of a monetary variable incursion into trade policy space. This is why I would
          advocate the pegging of the exchange rate for import duty computation to maximum of
          N1000/$ which could be reviewed quarterly.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          This is important to bring predictability to the international trade ecosystem. In the
          medium to long term, this section should be amended to vest the powers for the
          determination of the exchange rate to be used for import duty computation in the finance
          minister who currently superintends over trade policy matters. This is essentially a trade
          policy matter.
