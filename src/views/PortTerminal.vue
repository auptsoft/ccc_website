        <p class="mb-1">
          The core objectives of the Nigeria Customs Service Act 2023 are to reform and modernize
          the administration and management of customs and excise in Nigeria. It aims to enhance
          revenue collection, promote trade facilitation, and strengthen enforcement against customs
          fraud and smuggling
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          the Nigeria Customs Service Act, 2023, represents a significant overhaul of the customs
          and excise framework in Nigeria, introducing modern practices, stricter compliance
          measures, and a more robust institutional structure compared to the Customs and Excise
          Management Act, 2004.

        </h3>
        <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Customs Service Control</h4>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Art. 30 of the Nigeria Customs Act, 2023, outlines the responsibilities and powers of the
          Nigeria Customs Service regarding customs control. This provision is relevant for terminal
          operators in several key ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li class="mb-1">
            Goods Examination: The Service has the authority to examine goods to ensure compliance
            with customs regulations. For terminal operators, this means providing access and
            facilities for customs officers to conduct these examinations efficiently
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Inspection of Transport Means: Customs officers are authorized to inspect the means of
            transport used for moving goods. Terminal operators must facilitate these inspections
            and ensure that all transport vehicles meet the necessary standards and regulation
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Sampling and Interviews: The Service may take samples of goods and interview individuals
            who may have relevant information. Terminal operators need to cooperate with these
            activities by providing samples and ensuring that knowledgeable personnel are available
            for interviews
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Art. 32 provides for the application of risk management using electronic data processing
          technique before examining goods.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li class="mb-1">
            This is an essential improvement on CEMA act 2004 as it is expected to reduce the number
            of containers which are physically examined
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Art. 33 emphasizes the coordination and efficiency of control measures involving multiple
          agencies. This is critical for Terminals. Here's how:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">

              simultaneously.
            </span>
            <span class="text-red-600"
              >This provision is crucial for terminal operators as it reduces the time needed for

        <h4 class="font-bold mb-1">Uncleared goods</h4>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Art. 60 is very relevant and impacts terminal operators significantly through the
          management of uncleared and missing goods. Here's how:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li class="mb-1">
            Timely Transfer to Government Warehouse: On the 30th day after the completion of
            discharge of the importing ship, aircraft, or vehicle, the proper officer will provide a
            list of goods that have been unloaded but not yet released. Terminal operators must
            immediately transfer these goods to a Government warehouse or another approved place.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">
          Art. 119 specifically addresses the disposal of uncleared goods that have been moved to a
          Government warehouse:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li class="mb-1">
            Immediate Action for Perishable Goods: If the goods are perishable, they must be
            disposed of immediately. The Service has the discretion to determine which goods are
            perishable and require prompt disposal
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Fourteen-Day Rule for Non-Perishable Goods: For non-perishable goods, the importer has
            14 days after the goods have been moved to the Government warehouse to clear them. If
            the goods are not cleared within this period, the Service may sell them. The Service may
            extend this period at its discretion
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Public Auction or Tender: Goods that are not cleared within the stipulated time may be
            sold by public auction or tender. The auction dates are publicized in advance through
            national newspapers, television, and the Service's website to ensure transparency. The
            auction procedures are established by the Board
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Costs and Proceeds: The proceeds from the sale are used to cover any unpaid duties,
            storage fees, and other related costs. Any remaining balance after covering these costs
            may be refunded to the importer if they come forward to claim it within a specified
            period
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">
          The provisions of Art. 60 and 119 on the transfer and disposal of uncleared goods are
          cause of following concern for Terminal Operators:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-1">30-Day Period for Transfer to Government Warehouse (Article 60):</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Concern: The average dwell time for containers in Lagos being 18 days means there is
            little buffer for delays, which are common due to various logistical, administrative, or
            regulatory issues. Over one third of containers discharged are cleared after 30 days:
          </li>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Implication: This tight deadline can lead to operational bottlenecks and increased costs
            for terminal operators and importer
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">14-Day Rule for Clearance from Government Warehouse (Article 119)</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Concern: This period may be insufficient for importers to arrange for clearance,
            especially if they were already facing delays that led to the transfer in the first
            place.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">Use of Proceeds from Sale (Article 119)</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-1">
            Concern: The provision is generic and lacks specific details on the order of priority
            for covering costs, potential refund mechanisms, and the handling of excess funds.

                AEOs' compliance with customs requirements ensures a more predictable and stable

      <p class="mb-1">
        The Nigeria Customs Service Act 2023 introduces several key provisions that enhance the
        operational efficiency, compliance, and economic benefits for terminal operators compared to
        the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) 2004:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-10">
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold mb-1">Streamlined Customs Procedures:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
            <li class="mb-1">
              The new Act simplifies and expedites customs procedures through provisions like
              Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) status, enabling faster clearance and reduced
              congestion at terminals.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold mb-1">Improved Coordination and Risk Management:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
            <li class="mb-1">
              Article 33 promotes simultaneous control measures and electronic data exchange with
              other agencies, improving coordination and reducing delays in the clearance process.
              The enhanced risk management techniques ensure more efficient handling of goods.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold mb-1">More Realistic Time Frames:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10 mb-1">
            <li>
              While the Act maintains strict deadlines for transferring uncleared goods to
              Government warehouses and their subsequent disposal, it offers a more structured
              approach to handling delays and ensuring goods do not indefinitely occupy terminal
              space.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="font-bold mb-1">Economic Benefits and Competitive Advantage:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10 mb-1">
            <li>
              By promoting faster cargo turnaround and reduced operational costs, the Act provides
              terminal operators with significant economic benefits. The efficient handling and
              clearance processes attract more business, enhancing the terminal's competitive edge
              in the logistics and shipping industry.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-6 mb-4">
        In conclusion, the Nigeria Customs Service Act 2023 represents a significant advancement
        over the previous Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) of 2004, particularly for port
        terminal operators like PTML.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        By embracing technology, promoting collaboration, and streamlining processes, the new Act
        offers a pathway to enhanced efficiency, reduced dwell times, and increased competitiveness.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        As we navigate this new regulatory landscape, PTML is committed to leveraging these
        opportunities to further strengthen our position as a leading player in the Nigerian port
        sector.
