            <li class="mb-2">
              As standard procedures, if the issue is more of general importance, the committee will
              address it at the meeting. New questions or concerns raised during the meeting will be
              entered into the minutes by the Secretary

              and answering the particular query.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              The benefit from the point of view of those who ask the questions is that the customs
              authority is then obliged to respond to them. So, it is a very powerful way to bring
              an issue formally at the highest level of attention for Customs considerations.

              And if a company that is not by itself a member of the committee wants to raise a
              particular point, it should be able to do so with the representative association that
              should be a member of the committee. Usually membership is extended to companies and
              not only to associations.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              Many companies do think that life is easier if Customs do not know who is asking the
              question. That is one of the great advantages of a mechanism like the Committee, that
              you can ask a question to the representative association as an individual company, and
              the representative association can then ask the question to Customs, and the company
              remains anonymous.

              The agenda of a meeting consists largely of the information sessions of the customs
              authorities. That is presentations on current and planned developments. For example
              when the declaration system is changed, there is a presentation explaining the change,
              and there are also updates on important legislation, initiatives, etc.
            </li>

              Unfortunately, these days at many of these meetings there is very little participation

            <li class="mb-2">
              And when the meeting consists only of this kind of activity, the practice is that the
              activities has to be developed to an advisory Committee roles and only meets a couple
              of times a year to this effect.

              It becomes a one-way flow of information, which is not what the Committee is supposed

              The Committee is supposed to involve the active participation of the business

              a break in the summer. The Committee meet once a month because it is important that
              the participants takes an active part in the meeting.

              In other words, the general members, and the non-customs members, brought issues to

              Most companies don't even know that this Committee exists. You can see that from the
              fact that the representatives of the associations who attends the CCC meetings often
              come without asking questions because they don't get questions from their members,
              perhaps because their members don't know that this facility is open to them.

              The fact that, Customs is generally perceived in society as a very specific and
              particular area that is not widely discussed in the media. So, there is no awareness
              of how to deal with it. This is quite different from taxation concerns.

            <li class="mb-2">
              There is a forum that is very active at every meeting and members bring in lists of
              questions, problems, and complaints for the Tax Department to attend to.This is not
              the case on the Customs side but a proactive consultation. Again, lack of information,
              a lack of understanding that this possibility exists has been a challenge.
